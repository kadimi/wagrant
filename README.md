## GOAL

To streamline the process of creating virtual machines using the vagrant boxes provided by Microsoft.

## SETUP

0. Clone the repository, feel free to use the name you want for the destination folder, for example:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kadimi/wagrant my-win81-ie11
    ```

0. Run **one** of these commands to create the box you want:

    ```sh
    vagrant up                                   # Windows 7 with IE11 (default)
    box_name='msedge.win10.vagrant' vagrant up   # Windows 10 with MSEdge
    box_name='ie11.win81.vagrant' vagrant up     # Windows 8.1 with IE11
    box_name='ie10.win8.vagrant' vagrant up      # Windows 8 with IE10
    box_name='ie11.win7.vagrant' vagrant up      # Windows 7 with IE11
    box_name='ie10.win7.vagrant' vagrant up      # Windows 7 with IE10
    box_name='ie9.win7.vagrant' vagrant up       # Windows 7 with IE9
    box_name='ie8.win7.vagrant' vagrant up       # Windows 7 with IE8
    box_name='ie7.vista.vagrant' vagrant up      # Windows Vista with IE7
    box_name='ie8.xp.vagrant' vagrant up         # Windows XP with IE8
    box_name='ie6.xp.vagrant' vagrant up         # Windows XP with IE6
    ```

0. In the windows machine (the newly created guest), run this command in [a command prompt (aka cmd.exe) with elevated privileges](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc947813(v=ws.10).aspx). Once the set of commands completes, provisioning will be initaited:

    ```sh
    @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://is.gd/wagrant'))"
    ```

## NOTES

- Some apps are installed during provisioning, you can change that to your liking, see [`ps/Install-Apps.ps1`](https://github.com/kadimi/wagrant/blob/master/ps/Install-Apps.ps1).
- You don't need to provide the `box_name` variable every time, that's only needed with the first `vagrant up`.
- The command `vagrant rdp` may fail, this can be fixed by deleting the line with the faulty fingerprint in `~/.config/freerdp/known-hosts`.
